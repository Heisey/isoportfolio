        I plan on spending the next few years learning more about web design, 
        sharpening my coding skills, and moving south to a sandy beach close to the 
        ocean where I’m surrounded with fellow non-skaters. In the meantime, I love 
        traveling and learning about new cultures, and plan to learn a new language 
        or two (I’m looking at you, German). The ultimate 
        goal is to travel to Mars, where I can apply my background in civil 
        engineering to a truly greenfield project. Next time you see Elon, tell him 
        to give me a call.
