        I grew up in Calgary, AB, but I canâ€™t ice skate or tolerate country music. 
        Constantly seeking adventure, I spent over 10 years traveling Northern 
        Canada while working in the civil and geomatics engineering industry. 
        After receiving my lifetime quota of mapping government land in 
        temperatures lower than most people will ever experience, I turned a 
        lifelong interest in computers into a new career as a Web Developer.
