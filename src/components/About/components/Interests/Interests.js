        When I’m not coding or dreaming about Mars, I’m playing with my two 
        puppies. In fact, there’s a good chance I’m doing all three of these things 
        at once. The rest of my time is spent traveling, geeking out on computer 
        hardware, or assembling the latest model in my Star Wars Lego collection 
        (admit it, you’re jealous).
