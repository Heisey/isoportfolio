      Based out of Calgary, AB and spent over 10 years traveling Northern Canada
      while working in the civil and geomatics engineering industry. I recently
      turned a lifelong interest in computers into a new career as a Web Developer.
      I plan on spending the next few years learning more about web design, sharpening
      my coding skills, and moving close to a warm sandy beach on the ocean. In my
      down time I enjoy traveling, geeking out on computer hardware, and assembling 
      the latest model in Star Wars Lego collection. My ultimate goal is to travel to
      Mars, where I can apply my background in engineering to explore the new frontier.
      Next time you see Elon tell him to give me a call.
